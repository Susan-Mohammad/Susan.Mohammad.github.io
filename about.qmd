title: "About Me"
---


I bridge the gap between technical solutions and business outcomes by translating complex requirements into actionable strategies. My methodology combines:

## Structured Problem-Solving Framework
I apply hypothesis-driven analysis, DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control), and Lean Six Sigma principles to systematically deconstruct ambiguous problems and identify root causes.

## Data-Informed Decision Making
I leverage analytics reports to move beyond intuition, creating evidence-based recommendations that align with strategic business objectives.

## Change Leadership
I design adoption strategies that address both technical implementation and human factors, ensuring sustainable transformation through stakeholder engagement and targeted communication.
